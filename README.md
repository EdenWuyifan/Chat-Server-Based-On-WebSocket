## Installation

Make sure `pipenv` exists on your PATH, as well as Python 3.6.

Run:
```
$ pipenv install
```

To run the server, type
```
$ pipenv run python <filename>
```
OR type
```
$ pipenv shell
$ python <filename>
```
The above changes your shell into Pipenv's virtual environment.


## Running
```
$ python socketserv.py
```

Open `chat.html` to access the client.
